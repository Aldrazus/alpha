# Project Alpha

Hi! This is my first game. It's still a work in progress. Please be gentle.

Built with the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

Uses the [Mystic Woods asset pack](https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods) by [Game Endeavor](https://game-endeavor.itch.io/).

# Running the Game
